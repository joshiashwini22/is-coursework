          <p>

          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Positive impacts</h2>

          <br>
          <p>
            <h3>1. Communication</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
            The pandemic hit everyone and every economic area as hard. If the pandemic had occured a decade or two ago communicating with each other in such unforseen times would not have been as easy as technology has made it now. Even during such times where human contact was extremely limited the world was more connected than ever. Though it was not a good time people connected and reached out through social medias and news. Technology made virtual gatherings possible and kept the schools and offices running. People started living it as the new normal. Technology acted as a boon during that time.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Filmography</h3> 
            <br>
            <p>
            With the advancement in technology, filmography has reached new heights. Everything that you imagine to portray can be made possible with today's devices. VFX and CGIs have made the imaginations come to reality. 3D movies give people a different experience. Advanced video cameras have exceptional feature. Video editing softwares make the impossible come true.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Smartphone Revolution</h3>
            <br>

          </p>
          <p>
            Smartphone and apps have changed the way we work, communicate and play. As the advancement in technology increases, the e-commerce and internet-based companies have boomed as well. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Negative Impacts</h2>
          <p>
            Negative impacts can be condemned as inevitable in every area you could think of. It is like a chain reaction. The are a list of negative impacts that appeared as a result of development in technology. Some of the are as follows:
            <br><br>
            <ol>
              <li>Less-Active Lifestyle</li>
              <li>Lost Connection with Nature</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Less-Active Lifestyle</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
            In retrospect, indulging in devices has consumed alot of our time. There is an addictive element to devices. Everything is just a click away. This discourages people to get up and actually put effort into the work. Lack of physical activities makes a peson unhealthy and more prone to diseases. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Lost Connection with Nature</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
            People have changed the form of activities that kept them busy. Before people used to go for hikes and picnic to pass their time. Nature was the only place to go. But now those activities have become rare. Everything is on the devices. So people choose them instead of actually going out. 
            Kids aren't getting enough outdoor play time which is not good for their overall development. Young children should be kept away from the devices. They should be encouraged to play in the parks.
            </p>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
          In conclusion, despite the shortcomings of technology it has proven to be very useful. Exploring places and connecting with people is a wonderful experience in itself. People should try to utilize and not misuse technology. It should to used to do good. There sould be sense of cconscience while using the devices. If applied in the right thing technology can help built and repair the world.
